# Web-Scraper-Project-

A web scraper is a tool or program that automatically extracts information from websites. Whether you're collecting prices for comparison, gathering articles for analysis, or monitoring stock levels, web scrapers help you pull structured data from the vast ocean of the internet.

Send a request to a websiteâ€™s URL.

Parse the HTML response to locate and extract specific data (like headlines, prices, or links).

Store the data in a structured formatâ€”CSV, JSON, database, etc.
